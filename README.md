# Next.js on Netlify - Proof Of Concept

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f32bfd63-d1fc-46ff-8cb4-b738541bb715/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/netlify-nextjs-poc/deploys)

Auto-deployed here: https://netlify-nextjs-poc.netlify.app/

## Usage

### Getting started

To start your project, either:

1. Deploy to Netlify using the button above, or
2. Clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will take some time and will install all packages necessary to run the starter.

### Development

While developing your website, use:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/ to preview your new website. The Next.js development server will automatically reload the CSS or refresh the whole page, when stylesheets or content changes.

### Static build

To build a static version of the website inside the `/dist` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

See [package.json](package.json) for all tasks.

## Basic Concepts

You can read more about building sites and apps with Next.js in their documentation here:

https://nextjs.org/docs

## Doing dynamic things

A few resources for doing anything you can imagine with a 100% static site/app on the JAMstack
using Next.js. If you would like to add more resources please open a pull request!
